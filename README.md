# Business Overview

Many problems exist when deploying or transferring analytics to the cloud. Differences in features between on-premises and cloud data platforms, security, and governance
are all technical concerns. The danger of moving on-premises data into the cloud has prompted organizations to limit cloud analytics initiatives, especially in regulated industries where data protection is crucial. Cloud-based safe Data Lake solutions aid in
the development of rich analytics on data while classifying it into several storage phases, such as raw, cleansed, and analytical. This project aims to securely manage,streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos
data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.
