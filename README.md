# Business Overview

Many problems exist when deploying or transferring analytics to the cloud. Differences in features between on-premises and cloud data platforms, security, and governance
are all technical concerns. The danger of moving on-premises data into the cloud has prompted organizations to limit cloud analytics initiatives, especially in regulated industries where data protection is crucial. Cloud-based safe Data Lake solutions aid in
the development of rich analytics on data while classifying it into several storage phases, such as raw, cleansed, and analytical. This project aims to securely manage,streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos
data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.

# Why Glue :

 - Remove infrastructure management with automatic provisioning and worker management, and consolidate all your data integration needs into a single service.
 - Quickly identify data across multiple AWS datasets, and then make it instantly available for querying and transforming.
 - Using AWS Glue interactive sessions, data engineers can interactively explore and prepare data using the integrated development environment (IDE) or notebook of their choice.
 - More easily support various data processing frameworks, such as ETL and ELT, and various workloads, including batch, micro-batch, and streaming.
 
# When we should not use Glue : 
  - Amount of Work Involved in the Customization - AWS Glue is a managed ETL service for Apache Spark. And it is not a full-fledged ETL service like Talend, Xplexty, etc.
  - AWS Glue is specifically made for the AWS console and its products. And hence it isnâ€™t easy to use for other technologies.Also, it supports limited data sources like S3 and JDBC. Hence, you need to move your data to these cloud applications (if it is not there already) for the AWS Glue functioning.
This is one of the biggest limitations of the AWS Glue. To overcome this limitation, you need to have the above-mentioned data sources.
 - Limitations of Real-time data - As AWS Glue only supports a handful of data sources like S3, there is no room to include an incremental synchronization with the data source.

# Pricing 

AWS Glue ETL jobs are billed at an hourly rate based on data processing units (DPU), which map to performance of the serverless infrastructure on which Glue runs. For the AWS Glue Data Catalog, users pay a monthly fee for storing and accessing Data Catalog the metadata. The first million objects stored are free, and the first million accesses are free. A development endpoint provisioned to interactively develop ETL code is billed per second. [Link text Here]([link](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing)
